## Purpose of the Software

### Development Process
- Agile Methodology was chosen because:
  - Allows for iterative improvements to the model
  - Enables rapid response to user feedback
  - Better suited for machine learning projects requiring frequent testing

### Target Market
- Pet-related mobile applications: Enhance user experience by providing pet identification features.
- Veterinary clinics for patient categorization: Automate patient categorization for cats and dogs.
- Animal shelter management systems: Streamline animal intake processes.
- Educational tools for machine learning: Serve as a beginner-friendly project for ML studies.

## Software Development Plan

### Development Process

1.**Requirements Gathering** (Day 1)
Identify the scope of the classifier: binary classification (cat vs. dog).
Choose a lightweight yet accurate convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for deployment.
Collect a labeled dataset of cat and dog images (e.g., Kaggle‚Äôs Dog vs. Cat dataset).
Perform data preprocessing:
Resize images to a consistent shape (e.g., 224x224 pixels).
Normalize pixel values and apply augmentations (flip, rotate, crop) to improve generalization.

2. **Model Development** (Days 2-3)
Build a CNN model using PyTorch:
Use convolutional layers for feature extraction.
Add dropout and batch normalization for regularization.
Design fully connected layers for classification.
Train the model on the prepared dataset and optimize using cross-entropy loss.
Evaluate the model‚Äôs accuracy on a validation dataset.

3. **Web Interface Implementation** (Day 4)
Develop a simple Flask web application:
Allow users to upload an image via a user-friendly interface.
Pass the image to the pre-trained CNN model for prediction.
Display the result (cat/dog) along with probabilities.

4. **Testing & Validation** (Day 5)
Conduct unit tests for each module (e.g., image preprocessing, model inference).
Perform end-to-end testing of the web application with various test images.
Validate model accuracy using additional test datasets.

5. **Deployment** (Days 6-8)
Containerize the application using Docker for consistent deployment.
Deploy the web app to Vercel for scalable hosting.
Ensure the app is mobile-friendly with responsive design.
6.**Post-deployment Monitoring**(Ongoing)
Gather user feedback and monitor server performance.
Optimize model performance based on real-world usage.
## Future Roadmap üöÄ
### Short-term (Next 2 weeks)
 Expand to 10 common pet categories (birds, rabbits, etc.)
 Implement breed identification within species
 Add age estimation feature
 Mobile-friendly responsive design

### Long-term
 Wildlife recognition module
 Behavior analysis through video
 Integration with veterinary databases
 AR overlay for real-time identification

## Technical Implementation

### Algorithm
```python
class CatDogNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CatDogNet, self).__init__()
        # 3 Convolutional Blocks with increasing channels (32‚Üí64‚Üí128)
        self.conv1 = nn.Sequential(...)
        self.conv2 = nn.Sequential(...)
        self.conv3 = nn.Sequential(...)
        
        # Fully Connected Layers
        self.fc = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Flatten(),
            nn.Linear(128*28*28, 512),  # Feature transformation
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.5),  # Regularization
            nn.Linear(512, 2)  #
